Phishing is by far the most frequent and most dangerous offenses among cybercrimes. 
The aim of these offenses is to violate the information of the user or organization when they are going about their transactions. 
Phishing websites contain multiple clues within their contents and web browser- based information.
Our project trains the model using the Phishing Websites Data in UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. 
The google chrome extension extracts the same features using python libraries and uses the trained model to detect a phishing website in a very small amount of time. 
The performance was compares with other algorithms like SVM and Random forest. ELM is faster than both the other algorithms.
